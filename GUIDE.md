# bipbop! Character Set
ASCII is so yesteryear. Okay, not actually, but it is annoying in that it requires 8 bits, or 1 byte, of data per character. Now, I'm not sayin this because a byte is just too much storage. Not these days. However, when you only have 4 LEDs to work with and want to display more than the most basic of information with them, there's not a whole lot you can do as far as I can tell. Unless, of course, you develop an ASCII alternative that can work with just one nibble (half of a byte) of data! That's where bipbop! comes in!
